        <p>
            Throughout human history, people have witnessed the aurora – both the northern and southern lights – and sought to 
            explain and make sense of these dancing patterns in stories and myths.   
       <br>  <br>
        In the modern world, science has revealed most of the secrets of the northern lights (aurora borealis) and southern lights 
            (aurora australis). We understand that auroras form when solar particles collide with Earth’s upper atmosphere. Larger solar 
            storms cause a greater influx of particles, which can cause auroras to reach lower latitudes and appear to a greater number 
            of observers. The colors of the aurora come from specific gases that are excited by the solar plasma.       
        <br>  <br>
        Of course, we know today what causes the northern lights. But before we knew the science, 
            it's understandable that our ancestors struggled to comprehend what they were seeing.
        <br>  <br>
        Many myths and legends around the world are associated with the northern lights,
        as indigenous people tried to make sense of what they saw.

        <p>“When I look at the northern lights, I see our ancestors dancing around a sacred fire, lighting the way for us when 
            it’s time for us to cross over from this physical world and join them.”
